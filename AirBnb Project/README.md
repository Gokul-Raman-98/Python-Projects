# Project Description
## This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on New York Airbnb data to uncover trends and patterns in rental listings. We use libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seabornfor cleaning, visualization, and analysis.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to:

1. Analyze room types, prices, and availability across different neighborhoods.
2. Understand host behavior and listing patterns.
3. Detect potential outliers in prices.
4. Provide recommendations for guests and hosts based on insights.

# Key Findings and Insights

## 1. Price Trends
Manhattan has the most expensive listings, followed by Brooklyn.
Entire homes/apartments cost significantly more than private or shared rooms.

## 2. Room Type Distribution
Entire homes/apartments are the most common, but private rooms offer budget-friendly options.

## 3. Outliers in Price
Few listings priced at $10,000+ were detected, indicating the need to filter such extreme values.

## 4. Availability Patterns
Listings with high availability tend to have lower prices and more reviews, likely due to better guest experience.
